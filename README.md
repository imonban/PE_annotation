# PE_annotation

Welcome to the PE_annotation wiki!

A hybrid methodâ€“**Intelligent Word Embedding (IWE) **that combines neural embedding method with a semantic dictionary mapping technique for creating a dense vector representation of unstructured radiology reports.

We applied IWE to generate embedding of chest CT radiology reports from two healthcare organizations and utilized the vector representations to semi-automate radiology report categorization based on clinically relevant categorization related to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE).

Methodlogy:

Extract Impression
Pre-process text
Use pre-trained embedding to create vector
Use pre-trained classification to generate annotation
Generates annotation for PE positive (1 = PE positive) and PE acute (1 = PE acute)

Steps to create the annotations:
extract the zip
Run the PE report annotations.exe file in '/dist/' 
Input a csv file with 'Report Text' column
